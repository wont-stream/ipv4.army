I've been obsessed with a techno artist, [S*Y*N*K](https://www.synkofficial.com/), like, deadly obsessed, and I would love to listen to his music over on [TIDAL](https://tidal.com/), but he doesn't distribute his music anywhere.

So, I did the only reasonable thing, and made a SoundCloud downloader so I don't have to deal with paying for SoundCloud, or dealing with ads, or even dealing with python which is what most of the other SoundCloud downloaders are made with.

This is why [Silentcloud](https://heliopolis.live/seth/silentcloud) was born, a very simple and bare-minimum SoundCloud downloader that is made with Typescript, and is very early in development compared to AIOT, my TIDAL API, but it works, and it works well.
