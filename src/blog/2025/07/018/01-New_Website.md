title: New Website
---

The long awaited, exept not really since I've remade this site like five times in the last month or something, but I have finally made a new site, including a blog, which I will probably not use, but I'll try to use it as much as I can.

This new slick site is made with [VitePress](https://vitepress.dev/), which is a SSG (Static Site Generator) that is powered with Vite & Vue, and is technically suppoed to be used for documentation, but well.. I guess it can be used for blogs too.
