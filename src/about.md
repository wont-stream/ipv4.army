# About Me
---
Hey, I'm Seth, I have a passion for backend development. As great as frontend development is, I hate styling with a ***passion***, which is what led me to creating my site with [VitePress](https://vitepress.dev/).

Changing gears, I love high-fidelity audio, as I am a basshead, and compression absolutely destroys low-end frequencies. Which is why I use [TIDAL](https://tidal.com) for music streaming, and [UAPP (USB Audio Player Pro)](https://www.extreamsd.com/index.php/products/usb-audio-player-pro) on my Pixel 9 Pro XL to bypass android's shitty audio stack.

When I don't feel like lugging my [Fiio K3S](https://www.fiio.com/k3s) around with me to the gym, I use my [Nothing Ear](https://us.nothing.tech/products/ear) instead along with LDAC for the best audio quality I can get over Bluetooth.

Speaking of my Pixel 9 Pro XL, I have always been an `Apple` user. Started my journey early on with the `iPod Nano 3rd Gen`, then switching over to the original `iPod Touch`, which happened to go through the washing machine.

So I upgraded to the next gen, unfortunately the washing machine kept attacking my iPod Touches up until the 6th gen.
Eventually I switched over to an `iPhone XR`, which I used until I ran into the pool with it..
Then I got the `iPhone 12 Pro Max`, and further down the `15 Pro Max` after switching from Verizon to T-Mobile, which I used until I got my `Pixel 9 Pro XL` the `14th of April 2025`.

I haven't looked back since.

I've always enjoyed a little gaming, `Gameboy Color`, `Nintendo 3DS`, `Xbox 360`, and now PC gaming. (I still have my 3DS, and Xbox 360, and got a 3DS XL one year for Minecraft.)
I currently use a pre-built, but I do plan on building my own PC in the future.

PC Specs:

```
AMD Ryzen 5 7600X3D
GeForce RTX 5070

2TB NVMe SSD

I play a small variety of games, `FPS`, `Horror`, which happens to be my favorite genre, and a few `VR` titles.

I started my VR journey with the `Oculus Quest 2`, of course. The 2 got used for a good while, until I got sick of Wireless PCVR, which is when I got the `Valve Index Starter Kit` from *GameStop* Refirbished (Bad Idea).

I setup my index, mounted the base stations, and noticed the earcups would cut out, a LOT. I tried everything before plugging in an old pair of Apple Earbuds, which worked perfectly fine -- After I got an adapter to prevent the earbuds from sending mic input through the 3.5mm jack.

Later on I got two more base stations, with a total of four, one in each corner of my room, and got a new set of the Knuckles Controllers, which I will never be able to go back to the new generic style controllers which all look like a copy and paste of the quest controllers.

My VR setup is now complete, and I can play pretty much anything I want, with no issues, other than my PC struggling a little.

VR Setup:

1x Valve Index
